                <p> My name is Neal Partin, and I am a senior at UAB studying in Computer Science. I currently am working at Blue Cross and Blue shield of Alabama where I work in Application Development.
                    I also am a very big sports fan and I love watching sports in my free time with my friends. I love to watch professional Miami sports like the Heat and the Dolphins, but I also am a big UAB fan and I currently also work part-time with UAB Football in football video.
                    I love working there and its very cool getting an inside view of how the program I love watching runs on the inside. I would love to one day apply my knowledge of Computer Science gained in school here at UAB and experience gained at Blue Cross to get a job in software development in the professional sports industry.
                    I also love to play golf with my friends and family, thankfully I am better than I used to be and the game is much more enjoyable as I have gotten older! That's one activity that I love to do since it allows me to spend a good chunk of time in the outdoors with my friends and family which I find very rewarding.
                    Lastly, I also love to just hang out and play video games with friends on nights where there's not much to do. We play a number of games including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rainbow Six Siege</li>
                        <li>Super Smash Bros</li>
                        <li>Pokémon Go</li>
                    </ul>
                I hope you enjoyed reading some things about me!
